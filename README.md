# A Snap collector that wraps existing Diamond collectors

[Diamond](https://github.com/python-diamond/Diamond) is a Python daemon that
collects metrics.  This snap plugin wraps Diamond plugins so they can be easily
consumed by [Snap](http://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap).

## Getting started

### System requirements

* Python2 (>=2.7) or Python3
* Linux
* Required if building the the plugin package
  * [acbuild](https://github.com/containers/build) required for create a package
  * [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
* Required for testing plugin
  * [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (install using `pip install tox`)

### Installation

#### Download

You can get the pre-built plugin package for Linux (x86-64) [here](http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-collector-diamond/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-collector-diamond.aci).

#### To package the plugin

You will need to be on Linux with Python 2.7 or Python3 and a virtualenv activated.

To build package with virtual environment included you will need [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) installed on your system.

Just run the `make pkg` command to build ACI package. Package file will be available under "dist" folder.

### Example

#### Start snapteld

Before the plugin can be loaded a global config entry for 'diamond' under
collectors needs to be present with entries for 'collectors_path' and
'config'.  Below is an example (diamond.yml) config:

```
---
    control:
    plugins:
        collector:
        diamond:
            versions:
            1:
                collectors_path: "/etc/diamond/collectors"
                config: |
                    {"collectors":{
                            "PingCollector": {"target_google": "8.8.8.8",
                                            "target_grafana": "grafana.net",
                                            "bin": "/bin/ping"},
                            "CPUCollector": {},
                            "DiskUsageCollector": {},
                            "MemoryCollector": {},
                            "IPCollector": {},
                            "VMStatCollector": {}
                    }}
```

To start snapteld with the above config:
```snapteld -t 0 -l 1 --config diamond.yml```

#### Load the plugin

You can download the plugin package [here](http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/\
plugins/snap-plugin-collector-diamond/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin\
-collector-diamond.aci).  You can find more information on snap plugin
packaging [here](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/\
PLUGIN_PACKAGING.md) and [here](https://intelsdi-x.github.io/snap-plugin-lib-\
py/plugin_authoring/packaging.html).

`snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-collector-diamond.aci`

An alternative approach would be to load the snap_diamond.py file however this
would require that the Python environment available to the user running
`snapteld` has all dependencies installed to it.

#### Start a task

After starting snapteld and loading the plugin we will load the following task.

```
---
  version: 1
  schedule:
    type: "simple"
    interval: "1s"
  workflow:
    collect:
      metrics:
        /diamond/*: {}
```

`snaptel task create -t examples/tasks/all.yml`
